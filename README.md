# Midnite Name Link
Links nicknames and name colours with the Midnite Discord server.

## Features
Midnite Name Link displays the nickname and colour of Midnite Discord
server members in game.<br>
It currently supports nicknames and colours in the server tablist and player nametags,
and nicknames in chat messages.

## Configuration
Configuration options coming soon.<br>
To disable the mod, uninstall it.

## Disclaimer
This mod was created for Java 1.21 client-side Fabric.
I will not be making a version for Bedrock, Forge, or versions less than 1.21.
I may make a server-side version in future depending on demand.<p>
This mod only supports the [Midnite Server](https://discord.gg/ZmvHPeAfFs).
I am planning on attempting to make it work with all servers,
but if you want to use the mod on your own server, send me a dm on discord and I will expedite the process.
